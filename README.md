# ADAPT
ADAPT is a team formed to give a young boy a chance to move his arms again. There's a boy named Reid who was born with a condition called "arthrogryposis". The joint and muscle contractures prevent him from moving his limbs. He is capable of activating his core and his traps which is just enough for him to move the joystick attached to his wheelchair. Our team is searching for solutions to give him limb functionality once again.

## Our Progress
The team has built an exoskeleton that fits around his orthosis. The exoskeleton has a motor attached at the elbow joints which is currently set to work based off of an wet electrode EMG sensor. 

## Our Near-Future Plans
1. Search for potential solutions with surface EMG electrodes.
2. Build a full system to move a single arm with a joystick.
    - Includes battery pack, electrical safety, user interface, joystick, and motor.

## ADAPT Content/Files
This repository contains the data we collect from Reid as well as some of the code we implement into our project. We use multiple data collecting codes with Arduino breadboard and code for controlling the exoskeloton.
